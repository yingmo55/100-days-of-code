<!-- **Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. -->

### Day 0: May 17th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: 

- Worked on a resource page for a community website
- Worked on the HalfModal ticket for [Phlask](https://codeforphilly.org/projects/phlask--life-liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_water)

**Thoughts:** 

I finally made progress on the half modal ticket for Phlask today! For some reason, it took me a month to figure out where the existing functions and states were, but I finally found them in the code base & made the mobile view appear when clicking on a tap. I am still working on making it disappear when you click outside of the map, but progress is progress!
